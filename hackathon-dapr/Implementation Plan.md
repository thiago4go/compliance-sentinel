# Compliance Sentinel - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Core Strategy Questions:

1. Which hackathon category are you targeting?
   • Collaborative Intelligence (multi-agent coordination)
   • Workflow Resilience (fault-tolerant AI pipelines)
   • Distributed Architecture (scalable AI systems)
   
   **All three** - ensuring we have multi-agents, fault-tolerant workflows, and a distributed architecture

2. What's your main use case/problem you want to solve? 
   
   The Compliance Sentinel system helps businesses navigate complex regulatory requirements through an intelligent, multi-agent system that provides compliance insights, recommendations, and monitoring.

## 🚀 Current Implementation Status (50% Complete)

### Components Implemented (45-50%)
- ✅ Chainlit frontend with proper UI and communication
- ✅ Basic backend service with routing capabilities
- ✅ Compliance agent service with OpenAI integration
- ✅ Basic Dapr integration for service communication
- ✅ Environment configuration with proper secrets management
- ✅ Workflow agent structure (partial implementation)
- ✅ Harvester insights agent structure (substantial implementation)
- ✅ Dapr component definitions for pub/sub, state store, etc.

### Components Partially Implemented (20-25%)
- ⚠️ Workflow orchestration (structure exists but not fully integrated)
- ⚠️ Event-driven communication (components defined but not fully wired)
- ⚠️ MCP integration (code exists but may not be fully functional)
- ⚠️ Basic error handling and resilience patterns

### Components Still Needed (25-30%)
- ❌ Full PostgreSQL database integration
- ❌ Complete event sourcing and audit trails
- ❌ Advanced fault tolerance mechanisms
- ❌ Production-ready deployment configurations
- ❌ Comprehensive testing suite

## 🚀 Your Refined Implementation Flow:

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the Chainlit UI.
2. **Frontend to Backend Communication**: The Chainlit frontend service invokes the `adaptive-interface-agent` (backend service) via Dapr service invocation.
3. **Event-Driven Workflow**:
   - `adaptive-interface-agent` publishes an event to a Dapr pub/sub topic (e.g., `new-request`).
   - `workflow-agent` subscribes to this topic, initiating the workflow.
4. **Insight Harvesting**:
   - `workflow-agent` publishes a message to another topic (e.g., `harvest-insights`).
   - `harvester-insights-agent` subscribes to this topic, performs its analysis, and interacts with the PostgreSQL database.
5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - `harvester-insights-agent` publishes its results to a `results` topic.
   - `workflow-agent` subscribes to the `results` topic, aggregates the data, and stores the final result in the database.
6. **Notification**:
   - `workflow-agent` publishes a final event (e.g., `request-complete`) to notify the `adaptive-interface-agent`.
7. **UI Update**: The `adaptive-interface-agent` updates the Chainlit UI with the final results.

## 🏆 Why This Architecture Wins All 3 Categories:

### **✅ Collaborative Intelligence**
• **Multi-agent coordination**: 3 specialized agents with clear responsibilities, coordinated via pub/sub.
• **MCP tool sharing**: Sophisticated tool orchestration between agents.
• **Sequential thinking**: Advanced reasoning capabilities.

### **✅ Workflow Resilience** 
• **Dapr Workflow**: Built-in state persistence and error recovery using Redis.
• **Pub/Sub Communication**: Decoupled, resilient communication with retries and dead-letter queues.
• **MCP fault tolerance**: Graceful handling of external service failures.

### **✅ Distributed Architecture**
• **Microservices**: Each agent as an independent service.
• **Dapr building blocks**: State management (Redis), pub/sub, and secrets management.
• **Database integration**: Persistent storage with PostgreSQL.

## 🛠️ Implementation Patterns & Technologies

### **High-Level Architecture**
*   **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)**: Core of the system, using Dapr Pub/Sub for asynchronous communication between agents. This promotes loose coupling and scalability.
*   **Microservices**: Each agent is a separate microservice, allowing for independent development, deployment, and scaling.
*   **Orchestration Layer**: The `workflow-agent` acts as an orchestrator, managing the overall flow of the compliance check process.

### **Dapr and Dapr-Agents**
*   **Dapr Agents**: The foundation of our agent-based system. We use the `DurableAgent` for agents that require state persistence.

    ```python
    from dapr_agents import DurableAgent
    from dapr_agents.memory import ConversationDaprStateMemory
    from dapr_agents.llm import OpenAIChatClient

    harvester_agent = DurableAgent(
        name="harvester-insights-agent",
        role="Insight Harvester",
        goal="Extract compliance insights from various sources.",
        instructions=[
            "You are a Compliance Insight Harvester specialized in gathering and analyzing regulatory intelligence.",
            "You extract insights from various sources including regulatory updates, industry benchmarks, and risk assessments.",
            "You provide actionable intelligence for compliance decision-making."
        ],
        # LLM configuration
        llm=OpenAIChatClient(
            api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            model=os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o")
        ),
        # Memory configuration
        memory=ConversationDaprStateMemory(
            store_name="conversationstore",
            session_id="harvester-default"
        ),
        # Dapr configuration
        message_bus_name="messagepubsub",
        state_store_name="workflowstatestore",
        agents_registry_store_name="agentstatestore",
        tools=[]  # Will be populated with MCP tools
    )
    ```

*   **Dapr Workflow**: The `workflow-agent` leverages Dapr Workflow to define and manage the long-running compliance process. This provides built-in support for state management, retries, and error handling.

    ```python
    from dapr.ext.workflow import WorkflowRuntime

    wfr = WorkflowRuntime()

    @wfr.workflow(name="compliance_workflow")
    def compliance_workflow(ctx, input: dict):
        # 1. Start the harvesting process
        harvest_task = ctx.call_activity(harvest_insights, input=input)
        yield harvest_task

        # 2. Wait for the results
        results = yield harvest_task

        # 3. Store the results
        store_task = ctx.call_activity(store_results, input=results)
        yield store_task

        # 4. Publish the final event
        with DaprClient() as d:
            d.publish_event(
                pubsub_name="messagebus",
                topic_name="request-complete",
                data=json.dumps(results)
            )

        return "Compliance check complete."

    @wfr.activity(name="harvest_insights")
    def harvest_insights(ctx, input: dict) -> dict:
        with DaprClient() as d:
            # Invoke the harvester-insights-agent service
            response = d.invoke_method(
                "harvester-insights-agent",
                "harvest-insights",
                data=json.dumps(input)
            )
        return json.loads(response.data)
    ```

*   **Dapr Pub/Sub**: The communication backbone of our system. We use Redis as the message broker.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: messagebus
    spec:
      type: pubsub.redis
      version: v1
      metadata:
      - name: redisHost
        value: localhost:6379
      - name: redisPassword
        value: ""
    ```

*   **Dapr State Management**: We use Redis to store the state of our agents and workflows.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      name: agentstatestore
    spec:
      type: state.redis
      version: v1
      metadata:
      - name: redisHost
        value: localhost:6379
      - name: redisPassword
        value: ""
      - name: actorStateStore
        value: "true"
    ```

### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
*   **MCP for Tool Integration**: We use MCP to provide a standardized way for our agents to interact with external tools, such as DuckDuckGo and the PostgreSQL database.

    ```python
    from dapr_agents.mcp import MCPClient

    async def initialize_mcp_client(self):
        """Initialize MCP client for web search tools"""
        try:
            # Initialize MCP client
            self.mcp_client = MCPClient(persistent_connections=False)
            
            # Get MCP server configuration
            mcp_url = os.getenv("MCP_SERVER_URL", "http://localhost:8080/mcp")
            mcp_token = os.getenv("MCP_API_TOKEN")
            
            # Prepare headers
            headers = {}
            if mcp_token:
                headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {mcp_token}"
                headers["X-API-Key"] = mcp_token
            
            # Connect to MCP server
            await self.mcp_client.connect_streamable_http(
                server_name="duckduckgo",
                url=mcp_url,
                headers=headers if headers else None
            )
            
            # Load available tools
            self.mcp_tools = self.mcp_client.get_all_tools()
            if self.agent:
                self.agent.tools.extend(self.mcp_tools)
            
            logger.info(f"MCP client connected with {len(self.mcp_tools)} tools")
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"MCP client initialization failed: {e}")
            self.mcp_client = None
    ```
